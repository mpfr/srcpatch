.Sh NAME
.Nm srcpatch
.Nd patch source trees from
.Xr syspatch 8
generated files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c | l | R | r
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
applies patches to local
.Dv /usr/src
and
.Dv /usr/xenocara
source trees from
.Xr diff 1
files previously created when installing system binary patches by means of
.Xr syspatch 8 .
.Pp
If called without options,
.Nm
will apply all missing source patches by means of
.Xr patch 1 ,
after checking their signature with
.Xr signify 1 .
The output of
.Xr patch 1
will be saved into the same directory where the signed
.Xr diff 1
files supplied by
.Xr syspatch 8
reside, using the same file name with the extension
.Dv .log
appended.
Additionally, appropriate backup files used to revert applied patches will be
created next to the modified files in the source trees.
.Pp
The options (following
.Xr syspatch 8 )
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
List available source patches; suitable for
.Xr cron 8 .
.It Fl l
List installed source patches.
.It Fl R
Revert all source patches.
.It Fl r
Revert the most recently installed source patch.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/syspatch/*" -compact
.It Pa /var/syspatch/*
Directories containing the signed
.Xr diff 1
used for applying source patches and saving the corresponding
.Xr patch 1
log file to.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits 0 on success and >0 in case and error occurred.
In particular, and again following
.Xr syspatch 8 ,
exit status 2 indicates that applying source patches was requested but
additional patch was installed.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr diff 1 ,
.Xr patch 1 ,
.Xr signify 1 ,
.Xr syspatch 8
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared on
.Lk https://github.com/mpfr/srcpatch/ GitHub
in August, 2020.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
.Nm
was written by
.An Matthias Pressfreund .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
strongly depends on the files created by
.Xr syspatch 8 .
If binary patches get reverted, information required to revert source patches
will be deleted as well.
Therefore, source patches should always get reverted prior to binay patches.
